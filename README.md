The mushroom adds 100 points, Apple 500, Amanita takes life.<br>
An apple is generated after a random time from 2 to 7 seconds, replacing one of the Mushrooms.<br>
The apple will become a mushroom after the enemy turns it into a fly agaric.<br>
Amanita turns into a mushroom in a few seconds.<br>
If you lose your life, you degenerate into a random of 4 points on the map, invulnerability is hung on you for 4 sec.<br>
From the touch of snakes and spiders (3rd scene) takes life.<br>
When the hearts are 0 and you die or gathered all the mushrooms, the level restarts (the 3rd scene needs to be collected more than half (59) mushrooms before the enemy)<br>
Bonus health is added when scoring 2000 points, once.<br>
With each next scene, enemies better find their way to the player.<br>
Saves the best result in PlayerPrefs and loads it into the text at the bottom right of the screen<br>
Did not make an indication, won or lost, just overload the level.<br>
